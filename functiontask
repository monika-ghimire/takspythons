Function tasks:

1. Write a function to find the maximum of three numbers.
2.  Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.
3.  Write a function to find the factorial of a number.
4. Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n using recursive function.
5. Write a function called calculate_area that calculates the area of a rectangle. 
It should take height and width as arguments, with a default value of 1 for both. 
(Area of rectangle = height * width)
6. Write a function that uses a for loop to calculate and return the sum of the squares of the first n 
natural numbers. 
7. Write a function called 'calculator'. Create 4 functions inside it namely, 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication' and 'division'.
Call the 'calculator' function from the outside with two integers as parameter. The 'calculator' function should return result of all
four operations. (Creating a proper menu is a plus)
8. Write a python function that takes a list as argument and returns only the unique elements as output.
Example: my_list = [1,2,2,2,3,3,4,5]
Output : [1,2,3,4,5]
(Hint : use type casting)

9. Write a python function that takes height and weight as input from user and calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI).
Formula for BMI is BMI = (weight in kg)/(height in meter^2)
Conditions:
BMI < 18.5: Underweight
BMI between 18.5 and 24.9: Normal weight
BMI between 25 and 29.9: Overweight
BMI â‰¥ 30: Obese

10. Write a function to check whether the given number is prime or not.
